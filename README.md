# DWARF HUNT!



this is a java game I made from inspiration of a youtube video, essentially this gamee is a "treasure hunt" where the player aka dwarf runs around this world and finds mushrooms to unlock door by door leading to a magical ending.. this project covers all methods
within Java for a beginner like me I learned how to create the window, the engine, the graphics and the gameplay loop.. 

This game has 3 "mushrooms" that the player has to pickup to unlock each door in this gameplay loop, this leads to the end. And players can speedrun the game if they want to.

I created sprites and my own 16 bit sounds.wav for the first time and created my first ever game engine through Java code. All the assets in the game are 16px by 16px and all bin, resources, and source material was created and coded by myself. In the game I used 
a classic NES soundtrack that is way too big to be uploaded to github but just know if you were to play there should be background music when roaming the world created. 

# Inspiration 

I got this inspiration to create this project from a youtuber named "RyiSnow" who did a in-depth tutorial of step by step creation of your own video game engine that you have control of. Every aspect is created by yourself which inspired me 
to start coding in the Java langauge. Thank you to him.
